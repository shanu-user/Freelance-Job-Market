Business Problem Statement:
Freelancers struggle to identify and prepare for emerging market trends, resulting in missed opportunities and reduce competitiveness. They lack data-driven insights about which skills are in demand, what portfolio samples are most effective, and how to position themselves strategically in the job market

Business Constraints:
1. Limited access to real-time job market data across multiple-platforms
2. Data from different freelance platforms may have different formats and structures
3. Platform algorithms and policies may change, affecting trend analysis

Business Objectives:

1. Trend Identification: Identify emerging skills, technologies, and service demands in the freelance market
2. Skill Gap Analysis: Determine which skills freelancers need to develop to meet market demands
3. Client Preference Analysis: Identify what clients value most when selecting freelancers


Business Success Criteria:

Skill Demand Mapping: Accurately map which skills are growing vs declining in demand

Geographic Coverage: Provide insights for at least 80% of major freelance markets globally


The documents which I should prepare for data analysis project are:
1. Project Charter

5. ETL Documentation
6. Data Analysis Plan
7. Project Architecture (Optional)


Tech stack:
